Collection of models to test morpho

# data_gen_test:
Simulates a binned analysis.

The binned shapes
(representing several spectra) are stored in a root file, an
rdump file, and in the .yaml file, in order to test manner
of data input.

The magnitude and deviation to be used for each parameter when
generating counts are given in an rdump file "by row".
